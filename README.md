# Chatbot
We have used an npm package react-chatbot-kit developed by Fredrik Oseberg which can be found at [react-chatbot-kit](https://github.com/FredrikOseberg/react-chatbot-kit)

# Features
1. Based on the page context and the user context, the FAQ's that appear are different. Feel free to explore different set of questions shown to a logged in user, non-logged in user, KYC completed user, KYC incomplete user and a guest at different pages
2. To allow for the factor of usefulness of the FAQ's, a simple like/dislike button is provided for each question which affects the order in which questions appear to the user
3. At Account>Configure Settings, an option is provided to the user to set maximum orders per day. If the user happens to exceed this limit, the chatbot alerts the user about their purchase attempt.
4. For adding a faq you can have two options as part of working:-
    * Add a faq via our chatbot-admin portal
    * Put the data in mock_data folder in data.js file and finally run populate_backend.js that will take care of the rest
5. For adding a new category we have only one option which is to go to our chatbot-admin portal and go to "Add Category" section.
6. Test suite is being prepared in chatbot-backend to monitor API endpoints and their performances. Feel free to explore the endpoints and their testing mechanisms.

Note: 
1) For chatbot frontend a "clear messages" button is given beside the chatbot icon. Feel free to clear away the clutter
2) For the backend, mock_data contains sample information only to be used for db seeding and is there only to give structure of the data and how their extensibility will tentatively for more heavy-traffic data.
3) For user authentications, we have used cookies based sessions which can be changed as per requirements.

Feel free to share your feedbacks and suggestions for more improvements
